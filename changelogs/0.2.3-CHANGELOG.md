### Added
- We are now catching and logging unhandled errors and rejected promises!

### Changed
- The `Application` menu in the menubar will now show `DAWG` on Windows and Linux (this was done automatically on MacOS).

### Fix
- Extension loading now working on Windows. Previously a path issue caused some extensions to not be loaded.
- Fixed menubar and context menus in Windows. Previously small discrepancies in the behavior of these items between operating systems prevented them from functioning properly.
