> A DAW for the 21st century! 

## About
`DAWG` is Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) built using web technologies and distributed as a native application using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) ðŸŽ¹ It was initially developed as part of the 2018-2019 `ENGG 4000` (`Senior Design Project`) course at [UNB](http://unb.ca/) but is now being developed as a side project. `DAWG` strives (although currently fails) to offer the same functionality of DAWs such as `FL Studio` and `Ableton`. The name `DAWG` initially comes from our group name in the `ENGG 4000` course: `Digital Audio Workstation Group (DAWG)`.

## Acknowledgements
[GridSound](https://gridsound.com) was a great reference during development. For example, components such as `Timeline.vue` and `BeatLines.vue` were based off similar component implementations from [gs-ui-components](https://github.com/gridsound/gs-ui-components).

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) was also used as a reference during development. We are big fans of the structure and navigation tools (Shortcuts, Command Palette, etc) and wanted to implement similar features within `DAWG`.
